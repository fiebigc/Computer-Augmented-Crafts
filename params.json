Which recommends decisions to the designer whilst he/she works. The computer maps the making process, via sensors, instantly generating other formal possibilities based on the designers chosen parameters. The Computer Augmented Craft project is an attempt to utilise advanced technologies without sacrificing the unique qualities of craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nWith the support of developers David Menting and Martin Schneider, we developed a working system based on processing and arduino. With the opensource ‘generator’ and ‘sequencer’ any artist or designer can create a virtual mesh, that with the use of the setup can crafted into physical object. It is then in the hand of the craftsman to make the exact same physical mesh like virtual mesh or use the virtual mesh just as a base to create something totally different. Ideally it will enable the designer to create something nor him or the computer itself could have come up with.","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
